# SFML-Breakout
Breakout was the continuation of my learning of object-oriented programming with numerous block objects and gems on screen, both being created in dynamically assigned arrays. This game project brought a simpler and more maintainable code base whilst retaining complex gameplay mechanics. Additionally, this project introduced me into timer systems and their use cases. This worksheet game project was very useful to me for ways of improving code structure and maintainability.
